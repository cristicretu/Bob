### Bob

------

Bob is a speech recognition app that is always here for you, and most importantly, he is your best virtual friend, that can help you get through a pandemic.

### Example

```-
user: What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
bob: Trouble breathing, persistent pain or preassure in chest, confusion, headache ...
user: Thank you!
bob: I'm here everytime to help you, user.
```

### Purpose?!

He can both amuse you with his jokes, help you with important information about a pandemic and also he can give you basic information like "What day is today?" or "What's the time?".

He can also tell you how much time you spend on your computer, and he will remind you to about it and advise you to do some exercise or take some rest.
